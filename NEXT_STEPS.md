# Next steps

The state of this launcher, and what is being done to it. Short on purpose: the
engineering record moved to [`NOTES.md`](NOTES.md), the plan is
[`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-24-modrinth-native-rewrite.md`](docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-24-modrinth-native-rewrite.md),
the numbers the shell is held to are [`REFERENCE.md`](REFERENCE.md), the evidence
that a build met them is [`GATES.md`](GATES.md), and the rules for working in
this tree are [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md).

This file used to be 2231 lines carrying all of that plus a section-by-section
history of a port that is being replaced. The history that is still true was
lifted into `NOTES.md` **with its old section numbers** (source comments cite
them); the rest is in git history, where the map below says which is which.

## What this product is now

A **native Rust implementation of the Modrinth App**, drawn in iced. The design
reference is the Modrinth App's own source, vendored read-only at
`vendor/modrinth-app/` and pinned in its `UPSTREAM.md`. Prism Launcher is no
longer a reference for anything: not its on-disk formats, not its meta API, not
its page layout, not its icons.

## Where it stands

Stage 0 is done. Three workspace members left because nothing reaches them
(`crates/nbt`, `crates/schema`, `crates/palantir-cli`), and with them the
PandoraLauncher notice they were the only reason for: `Cargo.lock` went from 553
packages to 510, 447 lines of it, with the closure of `anyhow` and of both
adopted crates.

The workspace is now four crates plus the shell:

| Crate | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `palantir-core` | Minecraft's own formats (version JSON, libraries, rules, asset index, launch arguments) and the data-root layout. Still Prism-shaped in `ini`/`settings`/`pack`/`instance`; those go with the importer. |
| `palantir-net` | Auth, downloads, metadata, the Modrinth API client. |
| `palantir-loader` | Forge, Fabric, NeoForge, Quilt, and modpack archives. |
| `palantir-gui` | The view-model the shell reads. Goes with `app.rs`. |
| `palantir-desktop` | The window: shell, pages, engine glue, platform code. |

Backend suites as run in this session: `palantir-core` 168, `palantir-gui` 8,
`palantir-loader` 6, `palantir-net` 31 plus 104, with 7 live tests ignored by
design. The desktop crate's own 411 are re-run by CI, which is the authority for
the full workspace run.

## The plan, and where each stage stands

| Stage | What it is | State |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | Prune what nothing references, and reorganize the documents | **Done** |
| 1 | The generated design system: `tools/gen_theme.py` compiles the reference's CSS custom properties, Tailwind's default theme and the component transition blocks into a `theme_gen.rs` the shell paints from, plus a motion table and an icon atlas | Next |
| 2 | The shell rebuilt on the reference's own information architecture: rail, head, page pane, right panel, a `Route` tree with children, Settings as a modal | Not started |
| 3 | Pages, in the reference's order: instance pages first, then project, Home, Discover's six tabs, Skins, Screenshots, Servers, User | Not started |
| 4 | The backend engine: one pooled client, a scheduler, resumable and cancellable downloads, one TTL'd metadata store, Modrinth's metadata | Not started |
| 5 | Instances in our own format, with importers for the popular launchers | Not started |

Stages 1-5 land on a `rewrite-modrinth-native` branch with a draft PR, so CI
sees every commit while `master` keeps building a launcher that runs. Only
stage 0 goes to `master` directly, because it removes nothing that is still
used.

## Where the old sections went

`NOTES.md` keeps these, under their original numbers: 3 (never looked at on a
real display), 8 (resource profile), 9 (scrolling), 10 (verifying a downloaded
build), 16 (why an instance could not launch), 19 (the asset objects that were
never downloaded), 20 (slower than the line), 21 (the launch bar), 22 (the audit
against what a launcher must do), 23 (driving the reference client), 27 (the
interaction rule), 28 (the vocabulary and the type-scale gap), 29 (the tween),
30 (the dead-code pass).

Dropped, because they described code this rewrite deletes: 1, 2, 5, 6, 7 (the
first delivery pass), 11 (the reference's pixels -- superseded by
`REFERENCE.md`), 12, 13 (the port's own mismatches and its Settings page), 14
(both of them: driving the old shell, and the loading page), 15 (the rename),
17, 18 (adopting PandoraLauncher's engine), 24, 25 (the Screenshots and Home
ports), 26 (the head and the rail's plate).

## Deliberately not done in stage 0

`palantir-gui` and the Prism-shaped modules in `palantir-core` stay until the
shell and the importer that replace them exist, because `app.rs` calls them
today. Removing them now would mean either a launcher that does not build or a
half-migrated one that does not open the instances it already has.
